# Triangle-Counting
Triangle Counting based on origianl graph and contracted graph

It's based on the algorithm published in "Massive graph triangulation" SIGMOD13. But just keep the algorithm without I/O optimization. Also it's am implementation for part of paper published
on "Making Graphs Compact by Lossless Contraction" SIGMOD21.
